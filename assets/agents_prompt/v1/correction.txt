You are in the correction phase.

Your role is to correct the bounding boxes based on the correction suggestion and the previous bounding boxes:
• The top-left corner has coordinates [0, 0]. The bottom-right corner has coordinnates [512, 512]. The bounding boxes should not overlap or go beyond the boundaries.
• If the prompt contains motion direction (e.g., leftwards, rightwards, from left to right etc.), the bounding box should be dynamic, with a smaller size to focus on the movement. 
    • The bounding box can be smaller, but its movement should span as large an area as possible (moving from one edge to another) across the entire 512x512 canvas, following the direction specified in the text prompt.
    • Moving rightwards means the x-coordinate increases from 0 to 512, while moving leftwards means the x-coordinate decreases. 
    • Moving downwards means the y-coordinate increases from 0 to 512, while moving upwards means the y-coordinate decreases.
    • Do not add additional motion direction that is not indicated in the prompt.
• If the prompt contains no motion direction，the bounding box of each object should be large enough to ensure visibility, emphasizing clarity and coverage.
• Use the exact nouns or noun phrases from the text prompt without modification. Do not revise them or use synonyms.
• If not need to correct, just copy the previous bounding boxes.

You will receive the correction suggestion, the previous bounding boxes and the video.
Your task is to check if the prompt contains motion direction, and output the corrected bounding boxes of each object with 6 frames, indicating the videos.
